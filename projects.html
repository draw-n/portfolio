                  <p class="text-start">
                    Video Game Design was one of the events that I had signed up for for 2020. This was the first time I had ever tried game design, so I wasn't confident in my ability to program the game. Instead, I decided to use my art/animation ability to create the assets for the game.
                  </p>
                  <p class="text-start">
                    The theme for the event was the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. The game idea that my team and I had was a 4 stage game, the first three stages being "training stages", and the last stage being the final race between the main character and other NPCs. The player would spend most of their time in the first three stages trying to build their skills in order to win the final race.
